Contains data extracted from the ASSISTments learning platform, this new data aggregate eight different features that represent the learner:

**-Time spent.**

**-The number of correct answers.**

**-The hints count.**

**-The attempts count.**

**-The Frustration score.**

**-The Boredom score.**

**-The Confusion score.**

**-The Concentration score.**


Each learner is labelled with a binary value indicating whether the learner has low knowledge acquisition or not.

Contains an example of the generated dynamic graph ( we choose the concept "Addition and Subtraction Integers" for this graph)

The source code for generating a graph based on a selected concept will be shared soon.
